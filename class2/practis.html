    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>
      Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her
      desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist</i> and all the
      other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed
      copy of <cite>on The Road</cite> It had been Molly's favorite book since
      college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt
      she needed to be free
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with
      an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
      <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.
      Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of
      the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
      outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better
      to do.
